  summary:  AVGN Loading Text Mod
  description: |
    In June 2024, something unexpected happened. A crossover that nobody asked for but everyone deserved. Angry Video Game Nerd, one of the most classic shows on Youtube, played SimCity for Super Nintendo in an attempt to achieve a lifelong dream of getting a Megalopolis and Mario statue, at any cost! Just the idea of the Nerd trying to understand and explain the game is insane and hilarious. So much, it gave the inspiration of making a loading text mod with the Nerd reviewing SimCity 4, making fun of other city building games such as SimCity 2013, and of course trashing your cities and mocking your skills as a mayor. So, before downloading the mod, ask yourself first. Are you ready for a loading text mod unlike any other, full of insults, nasty swears and crude humor, all made by the angriest gamer you ever heard?
