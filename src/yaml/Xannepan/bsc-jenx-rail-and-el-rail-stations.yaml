  summary: "BSC JENX Amsterdam Central Station (old)"
  description:
    The station is build in a neo-style inspired on late-gothic and early renaisance. This is the central hub of activity in the city. It is where commuter, regional, and international trains arrive and depart. It is also the central staging area for the city's busses and tram network. There is virtually no point of The Netherlands that cannot be reached from the Centraal Station. In order to handle such a vast transportation network (more than 1500 trains daily), the station had to be big. So big on Amsterdam's shifting soil that it takes 8,600 pilings to keep the building stable. Outside, the red stone exterior is decorated with carvings, spires, and what appear to be a pair of clocks. One is indeed a chronometer. The other is a read-out for the wind vane on top of the station. While totally impractical in this time of motorized transportation, it is a nice homage to the city's seafaring past.

  summary: "BSC JENX Gare Du Nord Station"
  description:
    The precursor to the Gare du Nord was inaugurated in 1846 but was already inadequate by around 1854. Construction of a larger station began in 1861 and was completed in 1866. The station's architect is Jacques Hittorff. The main elevation, in neo-Corinthian style, is decorated with 9 statues personifying the most important cities of France and Europe towards which the railway leaving the platforms would lead. Inside, two rows of Corinthian cast iron columns support the main glass roof. Currently, Gare du Nord is one of the six large terminus stations in Paris. By number of travellers (180 million/year), it is probably the third busiest train station in the world.
