  summary: "Homes Pack by JMyers2043"
  description: |
    This set contains 18 home models. Each has 6 color variations. There are a total of 42 lots. The lots grow at stages 1, 2, and 3. Some homes are set at a 45 degree angle and are placed on corner lots. This package is intended to add variety to the beginning of the game. It also adds variety for those who enjoy rural region play where R$ residents reside. They will grow as long as there is demand for R$ and where there is low wealth desirability.

    **INSTALLATION:**

    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.

    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended--or a zip tool capable of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use 7-zip, and for macOS, use Keka.

    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything). Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins folder). After this, click over to the Install tab, and click 'Start installation' to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.

    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins. However it is also highly recommended to keep regular back-ups of your plugins folder or specific contents listed in the cleanitol scripts just to be on the safe side.
    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and separately all the individual cleanitol files and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
